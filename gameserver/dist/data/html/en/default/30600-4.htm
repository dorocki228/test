Newbie Guide:
<br>
At your level best to hunt <font color="LEVEL">Keltir's</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Elder Keltir's</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Wolf's</font> in the surrounding countryside. Wolves can still be dangerous for you. Be careful.<br>
If you select a monster in the top of the screen will appear the name, the <font color="LEVEL">color of which will tell you how strong the monster.</font> Begin the hunt for the monster, whose name highlighted in green or white. Monsters whose names are marked with a yellow or red, is much stronger than you. Try to avoid them.<br>
I must warn you: at your level best not to mess with the Orcs. They are smarter and stronger than they seem. Even with the support of friends you will be in difficulty. One Orca you can still win, but you two are no longer cope.<br>
