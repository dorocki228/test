Newbie Guide:
<br>
Hm ... You as a novice, still go to the weapons and armor, obtained by the Priests of the Flame?<br>
Well, the first time can not be choosers. Focus on the hunt and hope for good luck. The first acquisitions are your trophies. If you're lucky, pretty soon you got the <font color="LEVEL">Cloth Shoes</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Apprentice's Shoes</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Cloth Cap</font>.<br>
The guild you were given two weapons. Sword Squire and Training Fist. You probably already tried them and realized that the sword and brass knuckles different in their characteristics. <font color="LEVEL"><font color="LEVEL">Training Fist</font> allow inflict two hits instead of one. They put on both hands, so you can not use a shield. <font color="LEVEL">Squire's Sword (one-handed)</font> has a slower rate of attack, but it strikes more accurate. You still have time to choose weapons. It depends on all further training.<br>
