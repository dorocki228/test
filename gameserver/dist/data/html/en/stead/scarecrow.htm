    Hello, farmer!<br1>
    Local farms are often attacked by pests,<br1> thereby slowing the growth of seeds and<br1>
    making them not edible!<br>
    I try to fight them with all my strength,<br1> but you can help me, by doing so we<br1>    will both benefit!<br>
    To make it easier for me to work, you can<br1>
    pay my host <font color="ff5000">200 Adena</font> and I promise that<br1>
    your seeds will grow much faster!<br1>
    If you help me, I will accelerate the growth<br1>
    of your seeds for <font color="ff5000">12 hours</font>.
