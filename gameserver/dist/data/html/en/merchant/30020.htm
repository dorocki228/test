Baggins:
<br>Dwarves mine and work with a lot of materials and items.<br>
I became really good an item enhancement during my years of practice.<br>
If you bring rare items to me I can make them even better.<br>
<br><br>You can be certain of my skills.<br>
Regular blacksmiths cannot do anything of the sort... <br><br>
