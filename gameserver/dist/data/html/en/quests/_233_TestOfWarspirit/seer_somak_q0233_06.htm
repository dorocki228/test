Seer Somak:<br>
To pass the test, you must first find the bones of the ancestors who died in battle! Then through a trial you can win over the power of the spirits to your side!<br>
The ancient heroes that I told you are 4 altogether! Braki the clever, Kiruna the brave, Tonar the super, and Hermort the indomitable! Find their remains and bring them back to me!<br>
