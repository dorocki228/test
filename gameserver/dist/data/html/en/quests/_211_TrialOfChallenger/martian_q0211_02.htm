Let me see thenâ€¦ What would be good? Right, this one seems good enough. I heard that there is <font color="LEVEL">an evil creature attacking the villagers of Floran</font>these days. People call him<font color="LEVEL">'Gore'</font>. He lives in a <font color="LEVEL">cave near Floran</font> and messes up the village whenever he feels like to.<br>
I want you to go and kill the evil creature. The hero who saved a village... Don't you think that you should hold such a title at least to receive the mark?
