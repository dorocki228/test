Sage Cronos<br>
Are you the friend who Mirien sent? How are things going? I guess you are busy with the errands for those greenhorns? Isn't it annoying when they ask you to do this and that? They call themselves the High Priest or Grand Magisters yet they are cowards who are bold in words only.<br>
I bet they don't know any great magic... I think it would have been better for them to fight in the battlefields. They will never learn true magic by looking into the books. It doesn't help anymore to comfort yourself by saying 'That's the way of a Sorcerer'. Looks so vain, doesn't it? OK, I'll ask you one more time. What is your purpose of learning magic?<br>
