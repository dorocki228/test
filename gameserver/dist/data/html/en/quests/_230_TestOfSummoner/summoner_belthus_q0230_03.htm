Summoner Belthus<br>
I suppose you are aware of the rules? The challenger attacks first! It is the battle between the Summoner's animals! If a Summoner attacks the opponent summoned animal, it is a foul. Never blame the other Summoner even though the animal dies or gets hurt in the battle! <br>
If you are afraid you may give up now... Ha ha!<br>
