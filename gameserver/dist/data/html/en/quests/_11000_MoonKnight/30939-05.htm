Moon Knight Jones:<br>
What?! You saw Turek Orc's in Abandoned Camp? So... They got together and preparing to attack us together. This is a catastrophe!<br>
...But I think that it will be better not to hurry with the report of Sir Vasper. First, you need to collect reliable data. Kill <font color="LEVEL">Turek Orc Commander</font> around Orc Barracks and search his body to find any information about their plans. We haven't much time! I ask you to hurry.
