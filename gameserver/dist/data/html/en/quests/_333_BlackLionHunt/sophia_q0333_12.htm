Mercenary Sophia:<br>
The enemies that you will deal with are <font color="LEVEL">delu lizardmen, delu lizardman scouts and delu lizardman warriors</font>. As a proof that you slayed them, bring back the <font color="LEVEL">delu lizardmen's teeth</font>. But be careful.  Comparing with the felim tribe in Gludio or langk lizardman, they are much more violent and hostile.<br>
The more proofs of victory you bring, the greater your reward will be.  Well, since you once worked under Captain Leopold, you should already know the rule about proofs and rewards, don't you? <br>
Well then, leave for the battleground.  Trample down and destroy those lizards that are running amok without knowing their proper place!
