So... this is the way it ends. There's nothing I can do... love is so hard to achieve... and that makes it that much more excruciating. I guess that even this pain is a part of love. I don't think I will ever be able to forget her. It's a heartbreaking, but priceless lesson that I've learned. This is all thanks to you. Here, please take this. It's not much, but you've given me so much help in learning a little bit more about love, so please consider it as a fee for my lesson and accept.
