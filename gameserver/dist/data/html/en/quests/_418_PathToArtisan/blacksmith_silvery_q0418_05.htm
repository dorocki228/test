Blacksmith Silvery:<br>
I see your mind is completely made up. First then, let me tell you about the test of the Artisan. It is conducted by three blacksmiths, including me.<br>
I am in charge of the first part. The second is conducted by Kluto in Gludin, and the third by Pinter in the town of Gludio. First, you must pass my test in order to be qualified to take the other two.<br>
