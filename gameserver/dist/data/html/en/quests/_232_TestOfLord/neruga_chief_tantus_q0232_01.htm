Neruga Chief Tantus:<br>
Tejakar Paagrio! Praise the name of the Flame! Seeing the necklace that you are wearing, I suppose you are one of the Sorcerers trying out the Test of the Lord! So, have you come to me Tantus, the undefeated Chief of Neruga tribe to take the test? If that is so, I Tantus will teach you something. The thing that connects all tribes or kinships together is not the blood ties or the pledges but the state of mind of each member! And the 'one mind' can be achieved through sharing a common symbol! The totem of each tribe is such symbol! <br>
If you can get to understand the totem which connects all Warriors of Neruga, I will acknowledge your capacity as a Monarch! From now on you must find the materials needed to make the Neruga tribes totem!<br>
