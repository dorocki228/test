Miner Bolter:<br>
Hey, you! What happened? I asked for four things, but some are missing! I am sorry, but you need to go to the village again. Please try harder, if not for me, than for the brothers who work day and night at the strip mine!<br>
But ... Could it be? Did you forget what you need to bring?<br>
