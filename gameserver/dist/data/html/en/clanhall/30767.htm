<br>You want to look at the clan halls? <br>Good! A clan should really have a clan hall!<br> There are <font color="FFFB99">auctionable clan halls</font> to bid on, and <font color="FFFB99">provisional clan halls</font> that can be obtained through a lottery.<br>
Take your time and get a good look!
