Ha! Do you wan to add special abilities to your weapon? Great idea! Do we Enchant? Don't worry! Special effects have nothing to do with the Enchant. 
<font color="LEVEL">Our blacksmiths will help you insert a Rune into your weapon</font> if it has a necessary slot.<br>
You just need to choose which Rune goes into what weapon.<br><br>
By the way! If you have a lot of Runes you don't need, I can exchange them for other ones. Of course, no telling what Runes you'll end up with...<br>
But take a shot, it's worth it. Life is but a game...<br>
