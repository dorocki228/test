Blacksmith Silvera:
<br>Hello! How are you liking this cold weather? Brr! I don't think my toes will ever thaw! Good thing business has kept me busy or I'm sure I'd have turned into an iceberg by now. Are you a candidate for the Artisan test? Or can I interest you in a new dual weapon? Best craftsmanship in town....<br>
