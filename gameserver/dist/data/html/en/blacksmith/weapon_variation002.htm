I'll exchange two runes of one type for one sealed rune of the same level.<br>
Maybe you will receive the rune that you wanted after releasing a seal. In the worst case you'll get the same rune as the one that you have given to me.<br>
There's nothing bad in giving the runes that you don't need. Life is but a game.<br>
