Newbie Guide:
<br>
Um, you still go with conventional weapons and armor, obtained in a guild?<br>
Well, the first time can not be choosers. Focus on the hunt and hope for good luck. The first acquisitions are your trophies. If you're lucky, pretty soon you got the <font color="LEVEL">Cloth Shoes</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Apprentice's Shoes</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Cloth Cap</font>.<br>
The guild you were given two weapons. The dagger and a blunt. Hopefully, you have already tried both types, and understand the difference between them. The <font color="LEVEL">dagger</font> attack quickly, but rarely hits the target, but has a high chance of critical attack. <font color="LEVEL">Blunt</font> much slower dagger, but misses the target consistently. You still have time to choose weapons. It depends on all further training.<br>
