Newbie Guide:

Do you still wear the armor and weapons that you have given at the Cedric's Training Hall?<br>
Well, the first time can not be choosers. To get new gear, you need to hunt monsters. The first acquisitions are your trophies. If you're lucky, pretty soon you got the <font color="LEVEL">Cloth Shoes</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Apprentice's Shoes</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Cloth Cap</font>.<br>
At the beginning of training you were given two weapons. Dagger and Squire's Sword. You probably already noticed how much they differ from each other. 
<font color="LEVEL">Dagger</font> comfortable and well in the hand, but he has low accuracy. <font color="LEVEL">Squire's Sword (One-handed Sword)</font> slower dagger, but more likely to cause serious damage to the enemy. You still have time to choose weapons.It depends on all further training.<br>
