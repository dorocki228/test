Newbie Guide:
<br>
Good training will hunt for <font color="LEVEL">Keltir's</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Elder Keltir's</font> and <font color="LEVEL">Wolf's</font> in the north-west of the village. Do not underestimate the wolves, they are still dangerous for a novice such as you. But to hunt them need not go far, just to get out of the village and they come running.<br>
To understand just how serious contender for you to be a monster, <font color="LEVEL">look at the color of its name</font>. At first, better to hunt monsters, the name of which is shown in green. The enemies, whose names are marked yellow or red, a lot stronger than you. Try to avoid them.<br>
And yet do not even think about how to communicate with the Orcs. It is cunning and powerful creature. Still have time to fight with them. Even with the support of friends you will be in difficulty. One Orca you can still win, but you two are no longer cope. Listen to my words, I'm not bad advice.<br>
