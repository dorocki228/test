                Hello! Isn't it a beautiful day?
                <br1> Would you like to have a symbol made?
                    <br1>
                        Have you brought dye? Symbols are not easily made!
                        <br1>
                            You must be certain of what you want before we begin!
                            <br1> This is an expensive project and you cannot afford
                                <br1> any false starts!<br>
                                    Although expensive, if you choose well, your symbol
                                    <br1> will be a good investment for you, as valuable
                                        <br1> as an excellent sword or shield!
