I can tell you is proud of our guild.<br>
While the others brandished axes and spears, our ancestors already being used bronze tools, and studied the processing of steel. Black Anvil Guild has retained the tradition of the time and the wisdom of the ancients. All the great masters among the Dwarves - natives of our Guild. Our Mithril Adamantite armor weapons and valued around the world.<br>
Also, we will explore the science and technology of the Giants. The results of these studies can be called Siege Golems and flying ships. How can we not be proud of this ?!<br>
