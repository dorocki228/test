<br>Smelting means imbuing a weapon with different energy. Previously, that could only be done using Soul Crystals. But this is a simpler, if riskier, method.

Recently, a new ore was discovered. It is called the *Life Stone*, and it possesses very similar characteristics to Soul Crystals. Bring me a Life Stone, a weapon and a few other necessities, and I will smelt the weapon again by infusing it with the Life Stone.

Finally, it is possible to restore weapons smelted with a Life Stone back to their original state, but it is an expensive process to do so.

Now, would you like to try smelting?
