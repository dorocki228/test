How about you will deliver the armor instead of me! If you walk along a road to the west of Fellmere Lake, you meet <font color="LEVEL">Ol Mahum Hierarch Gudz</font>. Tell them about the evil Turek Orc's are planning. If Ol Mahum's find out what they are planning, they will not sit idly by and they will want to take revenge on the Orc's.<br>
So! Here is your Certificate Guild of Iron Weights. And take this bag with the armor. Do not worry. This stuff is made of cheap bronze, so there is no sense in the battle with it.
