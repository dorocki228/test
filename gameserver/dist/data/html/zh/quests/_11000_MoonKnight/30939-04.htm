Moon Knight Jones:<br>
I just received a letter from Damion. He asked me to tell you that all the goods that were stolen by Ol Mahum's were managed to be returned and forwarded to the customer. Damion is very grateful to you. Great job.<br>
But... There is a new problem. Scouts report that Turek Orc's began actively preparing for an attack on Gludin. I reported to Sir Klaus Vasper, but he just ordered to follow them. Sir Klaus believes that Orcs are too small and they will not dare to attack. Hmm...<br>
