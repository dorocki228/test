Blacksmith Pushkin:<br>
Clang! Clang! Smash with Maphr's hammer! Like smashing her window! Clang! Clang!

Burn it with Paagrio's flame! Like sweet nothings to my lover! 

Clang! Clang! Dip it in Eva's water! Like drying her tears! Clang! Clang!

Call it with Sylph's wind! Her laughter in my ears! Clang! Clang!

Bright Mithril, you light up the sky! Like love growing in my heart!

Clang! Clang!
