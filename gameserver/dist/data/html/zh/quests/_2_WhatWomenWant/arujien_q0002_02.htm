Arujien:<br>
...You... Have you ever passionately loved someone? Have you ever experienced a passion and affection towards a single person, emotions that exist every waking moment of your day? Now I understand why the poets call it a 'fever.' I...have fallen in love with a lady... It would not be a waste of my life to devote it to her.<br>
