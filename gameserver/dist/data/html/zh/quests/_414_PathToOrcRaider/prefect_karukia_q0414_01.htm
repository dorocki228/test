Prefect Karukia:<br>
Orc Marauders are of the most elite rank among fighters of our race! Their mere appearance on the battlefield makes the enemy troops shiver in fear!<br>
To earn the qualifications to become an Orc Marauder, you must prove that you have courage that has no regard for death, and absolute loyalty to the Orcs. There have been many young ones that lost their lives trying to prove their courage and loyalty! It is not something to challenge with a light heart!<br>
