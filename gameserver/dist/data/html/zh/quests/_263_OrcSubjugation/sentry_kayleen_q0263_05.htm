Sentry Kayleen:<br>
You have fought very well. In the name of <font color="LEVEL">Tetrarch Vellior</font>, I will give you a reward for every balor orc that you strike down. Those who fight on behalf of the race of darkness will reap a rich reward for their bravery.<br>
But the battle is not over yet. The foreign invaders still lurk in our woods! Will you go back into the battlefield, or will you stop fighting now?<br>
