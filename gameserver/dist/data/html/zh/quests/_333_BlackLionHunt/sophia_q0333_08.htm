Mercenary Sophia:<br>
The headquarters of delu lizardmen was originally located at the shore area in the southern part of Giran.  However, lately, many of them are infiltrating into Dion territory.  We don't know yet whether they are entering Dion just to find food or to prepare some large scale invasion.  But what is clear is that they are making their movements with some clear goal.  Our mission is to smash their units one by one and instill fear in them thereby discouraging them from settling down in this area.<br>
