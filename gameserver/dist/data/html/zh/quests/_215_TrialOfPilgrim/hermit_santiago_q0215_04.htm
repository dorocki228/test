Hermit Santiago:<br>
I will now impart to you a great truth. The people of this land have distorted and twisted the myths of their gods to suit their own financial and political ends. This is probably also true about the myths that you were taught... <br>
I teach a method of purging your mind of all the indoctrination that has come before, and learning the secrets of the gods afresh. Would you care to learn from me?<br>
