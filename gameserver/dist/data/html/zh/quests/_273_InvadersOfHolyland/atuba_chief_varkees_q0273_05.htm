Atuba Chief Varkees:<br>
Tejakar Paagrio! You've done well, young Orc. Though the red soulstone has not yet been found, the black soulstones you have brought will be of great aid in revealing the powers controlling the imps!<br>
As promised I, Atuba Chief Varkees, will reward you for each of the soulstones you have brought. Young Orc who has fought for our pride, this is a fair compensation for your hard work and sacrifice.<br>
