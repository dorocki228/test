Urutu Chief Hatos:<br>
Young Shaman of the tribe, thou shall remember! The story that we ruled the world and brought others to their knees with our power... You must not forget! The story that our cities were on fire and our people were killed by our enemies' weapons... <br>
Thou, who will take the Test of the Lord! If you wish to be acknowledged for the qualifications of the Lord by me, Hatos, you'd better be aware of the true meaning possessed in the totem which we, the strong-willed Urutu tribe serve.<br>
