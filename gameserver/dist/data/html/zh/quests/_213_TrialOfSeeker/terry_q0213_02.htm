Master Terry:<br>
Whew... I guess I have no choice. Besides, I was also curious about the increase of those mutations... Ok. But first I want you to do me a favor. I need some time to revive the Hawk Eye. In the meantime, I want you to grasp the situation ahead and collect the information.<br>
It seems that we can get a rough map of the monsters' mutations, so to start with, I want you to capture one of them as a sample and bring it to me. Let's make our next move according to the results.<br>
