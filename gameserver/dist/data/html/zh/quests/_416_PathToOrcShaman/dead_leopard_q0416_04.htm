Dead Leopard's Carcass:<br>
<center>
[A ghost is much like a fire:

approach it with great care,

a proper distance bear,

and grow as warm as you desire.

But stray too close to the source,

And it will eat you whole;

For ghosts and fiery coals,

Have no means to restrain their force.

Remember the teachings of Pa'agrio!

Remember the Song of Fire!

<font color="LEVEL">Drench your hands once more with the blood of the Black Leopard!]</font><br>
