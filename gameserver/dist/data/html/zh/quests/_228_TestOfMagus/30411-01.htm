Flame Salamander:<br>
What is it, my child? Have you no fear of fire?

...Ah, you seek the <font color="LEVEL">Note of Fire</font>... I see...

Of course I have it, silly! Nothing comes for free, however...

If you will journey north, near the <font color="LEVEL">Ivory Tower</font>, and retrieve <font color="LEVEL">5 Flame Crystals</font> from the <font color="LEVEL">ghost fires</font>, I shall take them in exchange for the <font color="LEVEL">Note of Fire</font>! But not one less than 5!
