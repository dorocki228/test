Maestro Nicholas:<br>
So, you are the one who is sent from the guild! We were looking forward to meeting you so much! If you are ready I would like to get on with the subject right way. First, I will pass on all the information that we obtained so listen carefully.<br>
A week ago, I went into the tower to do the research, all by myself. It was indeed a dangerous task for me, since such field investigations are not the kind of things that I specialize in. During the investigation I found a very old, <font color="LEVEL">tightly locked box</font>. The materials that the box was made from seemed impossible to belong to earth. As a specialist in this area, I can assure you.<br>
