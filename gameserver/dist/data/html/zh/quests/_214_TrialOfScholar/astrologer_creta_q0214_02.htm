Astrologer Creta:<br>
How is my old friend Marya?  She seems to have nothing to live for since she stopped making the Crystal of Purity.  <br>
This skill requires extensive knowledge of the coldness of the moon, and the waxing and waning of a star. I would like to help her in any way I can.<br>
You came to me seeking information, didn't you?<br>
