Sage Cronos<br>
Well well well... That was an unnecessary question... But it is true. In fact I already know who stole the bible. But it's my free will to leave him alone or not.<br>
As Dieter told you, there are 6 books altogether and you can only get the meaning when you have all 6 books. But I didn't want the Scripture of Knowledge to be widespread in the world.<br>
Because my bible is nothing more than a copy of the key of knowledge which the Gods made in order to teach the Giants. The Gods made the key of knowledge and taught it to the Giants, and the giants made the  <font color="LEVEL">absolute geometry</font> out of it. I copied it down and named it the knowledge scripture. I didn't want to present an imitation to this world. Moreover, I really wanted to prevent the bible from getting into the hands of greedy Humans or Dwarves.<br>
