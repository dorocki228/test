Marya:<br>
It wasn't very much different from the ordinary days. I was alone, dazing as always. Whenever I start thinking, I couldn't help but come across the day when that terrible thing happened... <br>
Ah! But then, Lucilla came and visited me. We have been close friends since childhood. Lucilla took me out for a change. ...We had a very good time, which I have missed for so long.<br>
Then it got too late so both of us spent the night in Gludin. The next day Lucilla went back home and I went back to mine. When I arrived everything was in a mess and the scroll that I had kept in the locker had disappeared. All I could find was the handbag that Lucilla had left behind.<br>
