Gatekeeper Valentina:
<br>Hello there! I don't look like a plain gatekeeper, do I? Haha. I'm actually sent from Ivory Tower. I know, the scary tower where the lunatics live...or was that greedy wizards plotting to overthrow the world? There are also those who think our mission is to save the world, too, I guess.<br>So which one do you think describes a gatekeeper? Guess wisely -- I'm here to help you travelers, you know! Hehe.<br>
