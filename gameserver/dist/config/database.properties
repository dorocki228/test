# This property controls the amount of time that a connection can be out of the pool before a message is logged
# indicating a possible connection leak.
# A value of 0 means leak detection is disabled.
# Lowest acceptable value for enabling leak detection is 2000 (2 secs).
# Default: 0
leakDetectionThreshold=0

# This property controls the maximum size that the pool is allowed to reach,
# including both idle and in-use connections.
# Basically this value will determine the maximum number of actual connections to the database backend.
# A reasonable value for this is best determined by your execution environment.
# When the pool reaches this size, and no idle connections are available,
# calls to getConnection() will block for up to connectionTimeout milliseconds before timing out.
