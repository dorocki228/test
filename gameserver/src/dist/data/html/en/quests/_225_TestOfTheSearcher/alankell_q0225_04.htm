Thank you for dealing with the delu lizardman. I heard of your triumph from Leirynn. <br>
What's this, you found a <font color="LEVEL">strange map</font>? Let me see it...<br>
Hmm... Dion territory... I can barely make out this name in the lower corner... 'Lambert'... Where have I heard that...? <br>
Oh yesï¿½  One of the Lord's royal guards had that name! <br>
I was under the impression that he absconded with Duke Ashton's gold bar during the farmer's revolt.<br>
