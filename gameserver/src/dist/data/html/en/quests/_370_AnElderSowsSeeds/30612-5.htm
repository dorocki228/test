Elder Casian:<br>
How could you forget? You must slay <font color="LEVEL">ant recruits, ant patrols, ant guards, noble ants, and the noble ant leader</font> in order to obtain the pieces of the spellbook.

</font>Examine any scraps of paper you come across carefully.</font> The pieces of "Kranvel's Spellbook" should be instantly recognizable.

You must find all four chapters: <font color="LEVEL">the Chapter of Fire, the Chapter of Water, the Chapter of Wind and the Chapter of Earth</font>.
