Master Khanelin: <br> Have you ever heard of the ruler of an ancient empire who sought immortality? For this, the Gods imprisoned him in a high tower. Locked down for many centuries, doomed to live forever, the emperor eventually went insane and turned into a monster. Since then, the ban on the search for eternal life - this is one of the immutable laws of the ancient empire. Immortality is one of the most protected secrets. And this mystery is known to the emperor.
