Magister Khanelin: <br>
The Book of the Holy One! You have found a relic! Great work! I use it to find out how you can resist a mad king. In the meantime, I have to ask you for one more favor. Nothing complicated ... Oh, how tired I am! Please, go to the next shop and bring me  <font color="LEVEL">Big Healing Potion</font>.By your return, I just have it all figured out. I apologize for making this request, but please do it for me.
