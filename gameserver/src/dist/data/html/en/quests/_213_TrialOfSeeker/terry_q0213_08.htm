Master Terry:<br>
Is the investigation going well? We don't have much time so you'd better hurry. Do you remember who you should catch? They are <font color="LEVEL">Ol Mahum Captains</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Turek Orc Overlords</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Ant Captain</font>, and <font color="LEVEL">Turek Bugbear Warrior</font>... Catch them and collect the bezoars from their bodies.<br>
I am not sure if it is because of the bezoars, but they are very <font color="LEVEL">aggressive</font>. Please, be careful.<br>
