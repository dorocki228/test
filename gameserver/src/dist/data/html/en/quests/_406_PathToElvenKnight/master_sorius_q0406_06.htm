Master Sorius:<br>
There is a place called the <font color="LEVEL">Grim Ruins</font> in the war-devastated area at the northern part of Gludio. Cruel and violent undead skeletons and the spartoi are disturbing and harming innocent people who travel near there. Elven Knights follow the teachings of Einhasad and Eva. There is no better place than the Grim Ruins where an Elven Knight can perform his or her duty. If you don't know how to go to the Grim Ruins, ask Guard Babenco.<br>
Please go to the Grim Ruins and hunt <font color="LEVEL">skeletons and spartoi</font>. If you defeat the undead, you will be able to get some <font color="LEVEL">topaz pieces</font>. You must bring back twenty of these jewels. Also, you must be extra careful because those undead can help each other.<br>
This is your first test. Now, it's time to test your talent. I will pray for you to distinguish yourself in war.
