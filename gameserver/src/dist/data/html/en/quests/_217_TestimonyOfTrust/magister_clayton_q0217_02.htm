Magister Clayton:<br>
Please gather all 3 materials that I have told you. Should I explain one more time? I have noticed that your people tend to forget things easily because they are hot tempered.<br>
Hunt <font color="LEVEL">the guardian basilisk</font>from the Corridor of Death and collect 10 bottles of its blood.That will make <font color="LEVEL">basilisk plasma</font>.<br>
And from the Wastelands hunt <font color="LEVEL">the soldier ant </font>and out of the 10 aphids you'll be able to get <font color="LEVEL">honeydew</font>.<br>
Last, from<font color="LEVEL">the swamp stakato</font> of Cruma marshland gather 10 bottles of the creature's body fluid and you'll get<font color="LEVEL">a stakato ichor</font>.
