Guard Coleman:<br>
Are you finished already? You must be exhausted! Thank you! You shall be well compensated. <br1> What is this? A document regarding the supplies? I knew it! There is a conspiracy afoot! I must take this to Captain Kurtiz right away! Thank you! <br>
 Oh yes, I almost forgot. Here is your reward. Here is some extra for the document... Will you continue to help me? <br>
