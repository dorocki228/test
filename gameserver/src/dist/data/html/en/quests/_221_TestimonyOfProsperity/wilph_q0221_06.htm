So you have met Rylin. You got the <font color="LEVEL">Rylin Elven Waffer</font>? What a precious thing you've acquired! Do you have any intention of selling it to me? If that's not possible, please let me have just one bite! Would that be impossible, too? Tsk. I guess you need it to pass the test.
