Grrr !!! Hear me, warriors! Our plans are changed! We dare to deceive, and villains should incur severe punishment! All ready! Tomorrow we attack the Turek Orc Barracks!<br>
By the way, You're a mercenary, right? Then once on our side, and bring me the head of <font color="LEVEL">Turek Orc Invader</font>! At least <font color="LEVEL">10 pieces</font>! Hurry!
