Amora:<br>
The order was made a month ago, but I only brought goods now... Delivery arrived late for a whole week. Moreover, too high product quality.<br>
Of course, I heard about the attack Ol Mahum's, but that's no excuse. It was necessary to organize a good protection.<br>
However, Ol Mahum's really were angry ... Well, in the first and last time I forgive. I'll pay for the goods receipt. Give it to <font color="LEVEL">Trader Damion</font>. And make sure that more delivery problems were not.
