I just received a letter from Damion. He asked me to tell you that all the goods stolen Ol Mahum's, managed to return and to forward to the customer. Damion very grateful to you. You have worked nicely.<br>
But... There is a new problem. Scouts report that Turek Orc's began actively preparing for an attack on Gludin. I reported to Sir Klaus Vasper, but he just ordered to follow them. Sir Klaus believes that Orc is too small and they are not resolved to attack. Hmm...<br>
