Contract? Let's see... This is a contract for the purchase of a large batch of armor. Look at the seal is no doubt that this is a sign Dwarves guild. So, Dwarves supply military equipment Turek Orc's?<br>
Hmm... It is necessary to find out what Dwarves guild entered into an alliance with the Turek Orc's. To do this, you must check what the guild belongs to the sign on the print in the contract, but can not ask directly from the Dwarves...<br>
By the way! You know <font color="LEVEL">Neti</font>, who lives here? We need to ask her! It is said that in his youth Neti lived in the vicinity of Schuttgart. So she knows society Dwarves.
