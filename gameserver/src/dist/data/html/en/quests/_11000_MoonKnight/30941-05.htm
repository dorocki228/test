Ol Mahum Hierarch Gudz:<br>
Oh, you brought 10 Turek Orc Invader Head!<br>
But this is only the beginning! Turek orcs pay dearly for having deceived us! Now my fearless warriors put on new armor and attack the Turek Orc Barracks!<br>
And you go to Gludin and give something to the local inhabitants. Tell them that the great Ol Mahum's this time showing generosity and leave them alive! But someday we will only match the Gludin to the ground, so let cook!
