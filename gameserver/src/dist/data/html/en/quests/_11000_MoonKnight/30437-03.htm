Lets you deliver the armor instead of me! If you go on the road to the west of Fellmere Lake, meet <font color="LEVEL">Ol Mahum Hierarch Gudz</font>. Tell him about the evil designs Turek Orc's. If Ol Mahum's learn that they were used, they will not sit idly by and want to take revenge on the Orc's.<br>
So! Here you Certificate Guild of Iron Weights. And take this bag with the armor. Do not worry. This stuff is made of bronze cheap, so no sense in the battle will not be on it.
