Trader Damion:<br>
You sent the guards? You are a mercenary? Hmm... <br>
Okay, to business. Here recently there was a nasty story. Ol Mahum's robbed a caravan, which went to Gludio, and among others kidnapped <font color="LEVEL">10 Mold's</font> to create armor. These materials were Trader Amora. They say she appreciates precision and strict implementation of all clauses of the contract... If it does not receive the goods on time, it may break off all trade relations with our town. And if other traders know about it, you can follow her example. This will bring huge losses...<br>
I ask you to! <font color="LEVEL">Find the stolen Ol Mahum's cargo and return it to Amora</font>. It can be found to the west of Fellmere Lake.<br>
By the way, while you are gone, I can tell you something interesting. Recently, I've heard some very interesting rumors...<br>
