Ancestor Martankus:<br>
What is this? It is a notice from the betrayer, the Ragna Chief! They say they will make a Chief of the one who kills the Paagrio Lord! This is an outrage! Betrayer's blood is even in their bones!<br>
You, brave Shaman, you have punished betrayer's tribe as I asked you. Proud of you! I acknowledge your service and hereby give you the Immortal Flame. Give this to Kakai!<br>
Oh! First Orc! He will personally congratulate your bravery! Although it is but a window to his soul, you will be able to speak with him for a while by using my power. What do you think? Would you like to meet the first Orc?<br>
