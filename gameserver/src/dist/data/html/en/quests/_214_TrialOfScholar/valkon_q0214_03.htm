Warehouse Keeper Valkon:<br>
So, you will pay for his debt? Hey since that man loaned 1,000 adenas... How long was that? Let me see... Yes, that was 10 years ago, 10 years! Do you know how much interest is drawn from that? If you compute it in compound interest, that would be... As much as 100,000 adenas, 100,000! You say that you will pay all that money for him?<br>
Forget it... I gave up collecting that money long time ago, instead I have a proposal. What do you think? If you do me a favor, I shall give you that Scripture of Knowledge.<br>
