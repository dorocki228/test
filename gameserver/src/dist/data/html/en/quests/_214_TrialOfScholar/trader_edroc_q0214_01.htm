So this is the letter that Dieter sent? Dieter... Ah! Dieter the blubberer! Of course I remember him! Did you say that he became a teacher of School of Wizardry? Oh, my! He made his way, in the end. He was apt to cry after being scolded by Cronos the wise, and everytime I had to cheer him up.<br>
Oh, god bless me. What did you say you came here for?<br>
