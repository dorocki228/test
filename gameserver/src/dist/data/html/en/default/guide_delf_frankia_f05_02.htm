Newbie Guide:<br>
If you have powerful companions, they may Buy Equipment for you. Otherwise, equipment for novices is provided by the Shilen Temple.<br>
For now, you should seek to master the arms and armor you already possess. You will sometimes obtain arms and armor from the monsters you hunt. With some luck, you may acquire <font color="LEVEL">Cloth Shoes, Apprentice's Shoes, or a Cloth Cap</font>.<br>
The temple will provide you with two different blades, a Dagger and a Squire's Sword. The <font color="LEVEL">Dagger</font> is swift, but its accuracy suffers, while the <font color="LEVEL">Squire's Sword (one-handed sword)</font> is noticeably slower than the dagger, but strikes with greater accuracy. Remember that different weapons may call upon different skills in their use.<br>
