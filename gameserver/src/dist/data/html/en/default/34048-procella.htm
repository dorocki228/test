<html><head><body>Wiri:<br>Ha ha ha! I knew you would make things interesting. The wind Spirit King’s name is <font color="LEVEL">King Procella</font>. I heard this from a survivor who found him and returned with his life: be careful of the King’s cyclone.<br>
He also attacks by cloning and replicating his body. I’ve heard if one of his clones dies, the others increase strength in anger.<br>
And if you're not afraid of challenges, you can fight this monster at the extreme difficulty level.<br1>
(<font color="LEVEL">For Command Channels of 27 and more characters.</font>, however, only character of Lv. 80 and higher are allowed to fight at the extreme difficulty level.)<br>
