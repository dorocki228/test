Antharas Watchman Theodric:<br>
What?.I Theodric, Antharas Watchman...<br>
My calling is to guard Antaras, the creation of the cursed Goddess Shilen. I make sure he never wakes up. For the sake of this mission, I gave my soul to the Darkness and turned into the undead.<br>
Even if you go into the cave, you will not get to the nest of Antaras. To get inside, you need to use <font color= "LEVEL">Portal Stone</font> and activate <font color="LEVEL">Chained Heart</font>...<br>
