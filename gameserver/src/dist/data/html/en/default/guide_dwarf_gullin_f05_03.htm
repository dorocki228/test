Newbie Helper:<br>
Right now, you should leave the village by the south gate and hunt <font color="LEVEL">Longtail Keltirs</font>, <font color="LEVEL">Gremlin Scavengers</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Black Wolves</font>. Wolves are the most dangerous, so take care. If there are too many hunters on that side of the village, look to the east side of the bank after you exit the village from the north gate.<br>
When you target a monster, the monster's name appears in the upper central portion of the screen. <font color="LEVEL">The color of the name tells you the monster's difficulty</font>. For now, hunt those that appear in white or sky blue. Those that appear in red or yellow are much stronger than you, so leave them alone.<br>
And be ye warned, you're not ready to go messing with goblins yet. They're a good deal smarter and stronger than they seem. Most importantly, they understand teamwork -- if one goblin is in trouble, others will come to its aid. So even if you're strong enough to take a goblin one-on-one, you're nowhere near ready to deal with two or three. Watch yourself now.<br>
