Clan Arena consists of 20 levels.<br> On each level you'll face to face the Raid Boss of the level. <br>To start the battle, talk to Arena Machine.<br> The remaining time is shown in the upper part of the screen and it's turned on after you've talked to Arena Machine. <br>When you defeat the Raid Boss, supplies appear on the territory of arena. <br>Each character needs to click the supplies to get the reward corresponding to their level.<br> Each character can get their reward from supplies only once. <br>Supplies are available to characters level 40 and above. <br>You have 1 minute to pick up the supplies, and the time counter stops while you're picking them up. <br>After 1 minute the supplies will vanish, and the next Raid Boss will appear.<br>
If your clan already has progress on Clan Arena, then before the first battle on the current week the previous level button becomes available.<br> This function allows you to fight the last Raid Boss from the previous raid.<br>
