Faulla: <br> Have you heard that Antharas has awakened, and that Bayum has gained even more power? The Order of the Knights of Baltus wants to test you in battle and therefore offers to fight with <font color="LEVEL">Zaken</font>, until he gained monstrous power. Although you know that the main goal - Antharas? Anyway, first defeat Zaken and get supplies from Lasha. Use supplies sparingly. <br> I move only characters above <font color="LEVEL">70 level</font>. <font color="LEVEL">I will move the union, if it has from 27 to 300 characters, to the village, which will be indicated by the representative of the union.</font><br>
