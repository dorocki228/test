Newbie Guide:<br>
Several of the villagers here could use your help. Talk to them and click on <font color="LEVEL">Quest</font> to see what missions they have to offer.<br>
They will not ask you to perform a quest which is beyond your abilities, so if they refuse to offer a task, it means that your level is too low to provide a reasonable chance of success. <br1> You should also know that there are quests that you may only perform once, but there are also repeating quests that you may complete several times.<br>
