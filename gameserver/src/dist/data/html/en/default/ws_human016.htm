<br> <font color="LEVEL">Characteristics</font> are a skill type that raise spirits strenght. Each time a spirit levels up, it gains <font color="LEVEL">Characteristic Points</font>, and its strength increases when the Characteristic Points are added to each abillity.
<br>When you evolve spirits, the highest possible level for the Characteristic increases, so evolution is essential.
<br>It is possible to reset at any time, so do not worry and add Characteristic however you see fit.
