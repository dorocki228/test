<html><head><body>Tara:<br>The place I discovered didn’t suit the lay of the land here, but it was full of the Energy of Fire, There was an enormous being enveloped in flames above the head of a woman, his expression read as if he was imprisioned. I knew at once it was the <font color="LEVEL">Fire Spirit King, King Ignis</font> But the strange thing is the Ice Queen Freya, is also there. Why she does she dwell in a place full of the Energy of Fire? More importantly, King Ignis hides from the world and gathers his strength there. If he comes cut into the world, the continent of Aden will fall in to chaos. The strength of King Ignis must be quelled before then, no matter the cost!.<br>
