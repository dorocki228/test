Fellow:<br>
The terrible news came. Apparently, <font color="LEVEL">Antharas</font> is awake! Now the dragon is held back by the seal, but the hour is near when it will fall and the monster will be released and will burn Giran to the ground.<br>
Do you agree to go to the Lair and prevent Antharas from waking up completely? Only a brave warrior can stop the dragon.<br>
I only teleport characters above <font color="LEVEL">level 70.</font> <font color="LEVEL">Antharasâ€™s Lair can have an alliance of 27-300 warriors. In order for me to use the power of the Watcher Antharas Theodric and move the union, his head should turn to me.</font><br>
