Newbie Guide:<br>
For now, the most important thing is to simply hone your skills in combat. What could be a greater priority in this time of war?<br>
Begin your training by hunting <font color="LEVEL">Red Keltirs</font> or <font color="LEVEL">Gray Wolves</font> near the village. Be cautious, particularly with the wolves, for they are very savage. When you find an item after slaying a monster, try to equip any armor or weapon, and see if it's better than what you have now. For the rest, if you have no other use for it, sell it at the stores, so you will have Adena when you need it.<br>
