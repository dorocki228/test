Armor Merchant Alexandria:<br>
Welcome! Thank you so much for visiting our boutique. We sell precious and valuable things that you would never find anywhere else. We've also added some luxury accessories this time. Look around to see if you can find anything you like.<br>
We don't accept cash. We only accept <font color="LEVEL">Crystals</font>. Thank you for understanding.<br>
If you would like to purchase a weapon, please ask my husband.<br>
