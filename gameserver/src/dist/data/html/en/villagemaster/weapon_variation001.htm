<html><body><br>Ah, so you wish to bestow a special ability onto your weapon! Good idea. Enchantment? No worries. Bestowing a special ability won't make the enchantment disappear. <font color="LEVEL">We can equip Runes to any weapons with sockets.</font>
<br>Choose the Runes you wish to equip to your weapons!
<br><br>If you have too many Runes that you don't want, I can also change them to another type. Though I can't choose the type of Rune that it will be.
<br>You should test out your luck. That's how life is...
