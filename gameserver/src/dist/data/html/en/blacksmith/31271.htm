Blacksmith Hilda:<br>
Do you have any business for Hilda? Hmm? Hilda is busy, busy! She must make swords, plows, polearms, and armor! No visiting! Hilda doesn't visit, just works! Hilda doesn't mind watchers, but if someone talks while Hilda works, someone might get hit by hammer. In the face. Hard.<br>
