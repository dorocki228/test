Grand Olympiad Manager:
<br>Every participant of the Grand Olympiad must know its rules.
<br>The Olympiad is held every day from 21:00 p.m. till 23:60 p.m. GMT +3
<br>In order to become a hero at the Grand Olympiad, you must gain numerous victories. The winner is determined by the 
amount of damage dealt. Damage inflicted on a pet has no effect upon the victory.
<br>The winner takes a certain amount of Olympiad Points from the loser. The number of points transferred from the loser 
to the winner is determined as follows: the number of points of the winner and loser is compared, and then the winner 
receives 1/5 of points of the smaller amount. The same amount is subtracted from the loser's score. If the result is a 
draw, both parties lose 1/5 of their points.
<br>The maximum number of added/subtracted points for winning/losing is 10.
<br>Olympiad Points are earned during the Olympiad season and allocated at certain intervals. At least one Olympiad 
Point is required to participate in the fights.
