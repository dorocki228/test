Frog:
<br>Once upon a time a terrible story happened to a brave Prince... Princess? A horrible spell turned her (or him?) into an awful amphibian. 
Many years have passed, and now nobody knows for sure whether it was a pretty young lady or a fearless young man... 
The victim itself cannot recall the circumstances in which it was cursed. The only thing it remembers is its royal lineage. 

For many years the Frog is wandering the world looking for anything that can help it discover its past. 
Can it be that its journey is over, and the one who can break the spell lives here, in Elmoreden?...

A good deed is never lost! Help the Frog and be rewarded!â€‹<br>
