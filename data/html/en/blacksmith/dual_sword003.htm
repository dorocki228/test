I think you know that you were in a special place. I am a very experienced artisan. At me you can order twin swords and get weapons of a higher rank. He-he ...
But keep in mind, it is not enough to be able to make twin swords. There is something else. Since this weapon is one of the most deadly, there is a restriction on its manufacture.<br>
So first of all you need to get a Dual Weapon Crafting Stamp ...<br>
If you have this document, then bring it to me along with the swords that you want to merge into paired ones. And I will make an excellent weapon for you!<br>
Ah! By the way, you should know that you can not combine swords with special properties.<br>
Also, remember: modifying weapons after unification disappears!<br>
Now choose the right swords.<br>
