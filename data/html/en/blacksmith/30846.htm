Blacksmith Wilbert:
<br>Haha! Blacksmiths do not just make armor, spears, axes and such. The Town of Aden would not exist without our Black Anvil Guild.<br>And, these are just rumors though... The word is that Tinplate Golem chasing away the Rulers of our lands were made by our Guild as well. Who could make these magnificent creatures if not us?<br>
