Gandi Chief Chianta:<br>
All Ord tribal chiefs possess a <font color="LEVEL">'Scepter of Flame'</font>. The scepter was bequethed to them by the ancient Priests of Paagrio, and symbolizes their authority.

As Envoy of the Lord, you must seek out the renegade Orc tribes and demand that they return to the service of the Lord.  You must obtain their pledge of allegiance and their Scepter of Flame!

These renegade Orcs are scarcely more than animals and should jump at the chance to rejoin the mighty Orc kingdom!

If they should refuse, you must take their scepter by force and deliver just punishment upon them! A punishment befitting fools that would refuse to accept their true leader!
