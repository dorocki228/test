This mission has to deal with weird evil creatures called *stacato* that are infesting the Cruma Marshlands.  Have you ever seen a stacato?  It looks like an insect.  It's a sinister race that gives you a creepy feeling.  Their body is covered by a tight stakato chitin and they have sharp claws instead of hands.  They also have surprisingly fast movements.  You should never underestimate them. <br>
To make matters worse, the Marshlands are inhabited by giant leeches, spiders and strange evil spirits hovering around the Tower of Giants.  This makes the place very treacherous when one has to carry out military operations.<br>
