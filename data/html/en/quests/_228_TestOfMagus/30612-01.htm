I am well aware that <font color="LEVEL">Perina</font> is suffering because of that monstrous flower... I have thought over and over about the problem for the past few days... My conclusion is that there is no other way than to find the creature before it harms anyone.

There is not only one <font color="LEVEL">singing flower</font>! There are 3 of them - <font color="LEVEL">The nightmare singing flower</font>, <font color="LEVEL">The phantom singing flower</font>, and <font color="LEVEL">The darkness singing flower</font>. We have to find all 3 of them.
