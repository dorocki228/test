Sage Kasian<br>
You have brought all the materials! Thank you very much. A Sage like me is no good at catching magical creatures... Good job, thank you. The process of making the copies will be finished soon. Please wait a minute...<br>
It's Finished. All done. Ah, I am so excited, I can't wait to read them. Here, I'll give you back the volumes 1, 2, 3 with my 4th volume.<br>
Wait a moment! What is this?<br>
