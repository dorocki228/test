Moon Knight Jones:<br>
Excellent work. Thanks to you, we managed to thwart the enemies' plan to attack. Moreover, now Turek Orc's and Ol Mahum's became enemies. I could have never imagined this! And it's all thanks to you. It is said that sometimes a soldier can do more than an whole army... Apparently, this is about you.<br>
You will get a decent reward. That's decision of Guardians of Gludin. Accept this reward in gratitude for all your efforts.<br>
You can select one <font color="LEVEL">Armor Set</font>. Only one, so be careful.<br>
