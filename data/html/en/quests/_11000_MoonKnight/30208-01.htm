Trader Damion:<br>
Did you send the guards? Are you a mercenary? Hmm... <br>
Okay, let's get down to business. Recently, there was a nasty story here. Ol Mahum's robbed a caravan, which went to Gludio, and moreover kidnapped <font color="LEVEL">10 Mold's</font> to create armor. These materials belonged to the Trader Amora. They say she appreciates precision and strict adherence to all clauses of the contract... If she does not receive the goods on time, she may break off all trade relations with our town. And if other traders know about it, you can follow her example. This will bring huge losses...<br>
I ask you to! <font color="LEVEL">Find the stolen Ol Mahum's cargo and return it to Amora</font>. It can be found to the west of Fellmere Lake.<br>
By the way, while you are here, I can tell you something interesting. Recently, I've heard some very interesting rumors...<br>
