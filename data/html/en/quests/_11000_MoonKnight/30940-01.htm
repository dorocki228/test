Amora:<br>
The order was made a month ago, but I brought goods only now... Delivery was delayed for a week. Moreover, too high product quality.<br>
Of course, I heard about the Ol Mahum's attack, but that's no excuse. It was necessary to organize a good protection.<br>
However, Ol Mahum's were really angry ... Well, in the first and last time I forgive you. I'll pay for the goods receipt. Give it to <font color="LEVEL">Trader Damion</font>. And make sure that there won't be any problems with delivery anymore.
