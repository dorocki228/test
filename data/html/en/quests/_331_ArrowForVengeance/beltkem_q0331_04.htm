Guard Belton:<br>
You've come back empty-handed. Did you not promise to bring me <font color="LEVEL">harpy's feathers, the teeth of the worm</font> and <font color="LEVEL">the poison of the medusa</font>?<br>
As soon as you obtain these three materials, bring them to me. I will reward you for each that you bring back. I've inherited quite a fortune from my deceased parents, so don't worry about the reward. Please don't quit, help me.<br>
