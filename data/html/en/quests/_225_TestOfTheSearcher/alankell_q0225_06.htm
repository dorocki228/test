Alex:<br>
I believe this map will lead us to the prince's gold! I wonder how that delu lizardman 
got this? <br>
If we can get to the gold before our opponents we will be able to hire soldiers and buy weapons with which to defend the village.<br>
Think of this as your last test.  You must find the other parts of this map and <font color="LEVEL">get the prince's lost gold bar</font>. <br>
Whether you are successful or not, I will write you the letter of recommendation you need.<br>
