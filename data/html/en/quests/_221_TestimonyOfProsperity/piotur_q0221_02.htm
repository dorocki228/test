Piotur:<br>
Hope... Hope... Yesï¿½ It is not so hopeless after all...<br>
These days, the hired troops are taking care of the Orcs. And my brothers are working day and night to reclaim the land. Someday, this place could be the richest land in the kingdom of Aden...!<br>
By the way... You said that you were searching for the <font color="LEVEL">Token of the Fertile Lands</font>? OK, then I shall give you something that I treasure. I was given this thing from a stranger Dwarf, when I first came to this land and lost hope because of my failure of crops. He gave me this seed and said that <font color="LEVEL">the blessings of Maphr, God of earth are dwelling in the seed</font>.<br>
And when I grew crops with this seed, it was actually very successful, and the land became even richer. Therefore I kept some of the seeds and saved them until this day. This is indeed my biggest hope. Now I shall share the seeds with you. It is strange that I return the gift from a Dwarf to another Dwarf.
