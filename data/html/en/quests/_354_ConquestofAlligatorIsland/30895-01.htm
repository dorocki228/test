Morita:<br>
I'm glad to see You!<br>
We, dwarves, are born traders. It has always been. But lately the people in power decided to cut us a trade route.<br>
Boycott people! We are going to organize a trade on the lands of the Alligator Island! The only problem is the abundance of monsters on this earth.<br>
Will you help us?<br>
